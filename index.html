    <h2>My Self-Construction Journey</h2>
    <p>When I look back on my childhood, I see someone who was deeply influenced by my parents—obedient, kind, and grounded in values that emphasized respect and hospitality. Growing up in the Philippines helped reinforce these values. The warmth and politeness of the people I was surrounded with became a foundation for how I interact with others today...</p>

  <section id="interview">
    <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of how others perceive me, I interviewed two people close to me. They described me as someone who is eager to learn and easy to approach. While I come off as shy and nonchalant, my personality is generally relaxed and easygoing. They highlighted strengths such as being a good listener and having an open mind. However, they also noted areas for improvement like being lazy at times and handling pressure poorly. Importantly, both interviewees acknowledged my growth—particularly in communication skills and time management.</p>

  <section id="concepts">
    <h2>Integrating Course Concepts in My Self-Understanding</h2>
    <p>The different concepts we explored in this course helped me view my self-construction more holistically. I relate to the existentialist view, and recognize how biological traits, culture, body image, personality, and mental health contribute to the evolving definition of who I am...</p>

  <section id="health">
    <h2>My Health Manifesto</h2>
    <h3>Physical Health</h3>
    <p>I will begin incorporating movement and light exercise into my week—not to meet expectations, but to feel stronger and more energetic. I also commit to eating more regularly and mindfully, especially during times of academic stress.</p>
    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
    <p>I will practice mindfulness, journal when needed, and seek safe spaces for emotional expression. I’ll continue valuing kindness and open-mindedness—my core strengths—and work on letting go of the pressure to have all the answers about who I am.</p>
    <h3>Emotional Well-being</h3>
    <p>I aim to be more expressive and emotionally honest with others. This means taking small steps in conversations, allowing vulnerability, and acknowledging that discomfort often precedes growth.</p>
    <h3>Academic-Life Balance</h3>
    <p>I will strive for balance, not burnout. By improving time management, setting boundaries, and prioritizing rest, I hope to stay motivated without sacrificing my well-being.</p>
