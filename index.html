    <h2>My Self-Construction Journey</h2>
    <p>As Mavrick Velasco, my journey of self-construction began in early childhood, where I followed my parents' guidance and embraced their values. Growing up in the Philippines instilled in me a deep sense of kindness and hospitality—qualities that I still carry today. I used to struggle with my curly hair and tried to straighten it to fit in, but now I've come to embrace it as part of my unique identity. </p>
    <p>Physically, I was once chubby and not very active due to a lack of exposure to sports. Though I've slimmed down, I now struggle with being skinny and feeling weak, which has become a source of insecurity. Emotionally and mentally, I used to be extremely sheltered, which made me sensitive to criticism. Over time, particularly in high school and now college, I’ve learned to be more open-minded, kind, and understanding of different perspectives. However, I still don’t have a firm grasp of who I truly am. I know I'm on a path of exploration, eager to try new things while maintaining a smile and respecting others.</p>
    <p>College has taken a toll on my mental health. Sleepless nights and poor eating and exercise habits have left me drained, but self-awareness is helping me slowly work on it. I still view myself as childish at times, but I know I'm growing—and that's what matters most.</p>

  <section id="interview">
    <h2>Interview Summary</h2>
    <p>To understand how others see me, I interviewed two people close to me. They said I come across as someone very eager to learn and easy to talk to. While I appear shy and chill, they also recognized that I'm approachable and friendly. One recurring theme was that I'm a good listener, open-minded to different perspectives, and have a calm presence.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, they pointed out that I can be lazy at times and tend to perform poorly under pressure. They also mentioned that I tend to keep to myself emotionally and struggle to express my feelings. Despite these challenges, they noted that I've been improving, especially in communication and time management. These interviews helped me realize how my past experiences have shaped my current self—and how much potential I have for growth.</p>

  <section id="concepts">
    <h2>Integrating Course Concepts in My Self-Understanding</h2>
    <p>The course modules have given me a wider lens to see myself. The "Perspectives of the Self" module made me reflect on how I define myself through my choices (existentialist view), while also understanding the roles of society and culture. My Filipino upbringing plays a big part in how I relate to others—kindness, humility, and respect are integral to how I interact with people.</p>
    <p>Biological influences made me recognize how my body image issues developed over time. The "Personality" and "Identity Development" modules helped me understand that I am still discovering who I am. Through the "Sexuality" module, I realized that I grew up with a heteronormative perspective that shaped my identity early on.</p>
    <p>When it comes to "Mental Health and Wellbeing," I’ve become more aware of how college stress affects me. Lack of sleep, poor eating, and absence of exercise are things I need to address. This understanding helped me shape a more realistic and honest view of myself—not someone fully formed, but someone always evolving.</p>

    <h2>My Health Manifesto</h2>
    <h3>Physical Health</h3>
    <p>I, Mavrick Velasco, commit to incorporating regular physical activity into my routine. Whether it's short walks, stretching, or beginner workouts, I will do it not for appearance, but to feel better and stronger. I will also aim to eat balanced meals more regularly, especially when school becomes overwhelming.</p>
    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
    <p>I will prioritize mental rest. This means journaling my thoughts, setting boundaries around technology, and practicing mindfulness. I recognize that my mind needs care, just like my body. I will allow myself moments of stillness without guilt.</p>
    <h3>Emotional Well-being</h3>
    <p>I will work on expressing myself more. I understand now that it's okay to be vulnerable, and being emotionally honest will help me connect better with others. Every honest conversation I engage in is a small victory in becoming more authentic.</p>
    <h3>Academic-Life Balance</h3>
    <p>I promise to improve my time management through planning and prioritization. I’ll remind myself that grades do not define me, and burnout is not a badge of honor. Rest is not laziness—it is self-respect.</p>
